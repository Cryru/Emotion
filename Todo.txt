DataBuffer.CreateMapper
	- Only the data that needs mapping should be downloaded from the GPU. Currently the whole range is being downloaded. Additionally maybe internally it should be held in a byte span.
Commands
	- Merge state changing commands one after another into one.
GL
	- Investigate why the VertexArrayObject binding cache doesn't work. Maybe VertexArrayBinding isn't the right value?
Rendering
	- Add state changes test
Standard.Image
	- PNG: Make the conversion to 32bpp little endian and the inverting in place when encoding the data rather than at the start.
	- Implement ByteWriter and use it to encode the images.
	- JPEG Support
	- Add tests for image encoding
Logging
	- Filtering
Standard.Text
	- Improve the CFF dictionary parsing with a class with annotations instead of the dictionary hell happening there.
	- WOFF table parsing (and whatever else is needed for it to be supported)
	- Kern table and kerning
	- FDSelect array CFF subr. (No font found which does this.)
	- LTag parsing (couldn't find such font)
	- Cff fonts without a CMap (couldn't find such font)
	- GSub table
	- GPos table
	- FVar table
	- Meta table
	- Improve Glyf glyph parsing. Currently it cannot be multi-threaded because of the composite parts. Maybe it should be done in two passes.
	- Long Term: Implement the FreeType rasterizer.
	- Glyf: No contour error handling
	- RenderGlyph, "e" variable resizing is not really needed.
Emotion.Test
	- Derivation checks shouldn't straight out check if the components are equal, but rather compare the difference to an epsilon as some drivers round colors differently
