IO
	- "Relative to" support for things like the shaders which reference other assets.
DataBuffer.CreateMapper
	- Only the data that needs mapping should be downloaded from the GPU. Currently the whole range is being downloaded. Additionally maybe internally it should be held in a byte span.
Commands
	- Merge state changing commands one after another into one.
	- Some kind of shared cache buffer for commands rather than the pool which exists now.
	- Maybe get rid of commands?
GL
	- Investigate why the VertexArrayObject binding cache doesn't work. Maybe VertexArrayBinding isn't the right value?
Rendering
	- Add tests for state changes
	- Add tests for various batch stuff
	- Uniform blocks (UBO) for syncing shaders
	- When the batch memory is dirty, don't upload all of it. Just the part that's updated. Replace "_upload" will some kind of min-max indices.
Standard.Image
	- Implement ByteWriter and use it to encode the images.
	- JPEG Support
	- Add tests for image encoding
	- Would be nice to have to provide some sort of PixelFormat to Encode, Decode. Currently only BGRA is passed around.
Logging
	- Filtering
	- Shaking off dependencies
	- Hooking up a network loggers for certain levels (errors) and sources (engine, game)
Standard.Text
	- Improve the CFF dictionary parsing with a class with annotations instead of the dictionary hell happening there.
	- WOFF table parsing (and whatever else is needed for it to be supported)
	- Kern table and kerning
	- FDSelect array CFF subr. (No font found which does this.)
	- LTag parsing (couldn't find such font)
	- Cff fonts without a CMap (couldn't find such font)
	- GSub table
	- GPos table
	- FVar table
	- Meta table
	- Long Term: Implement the FreeType rasterizer.
	- RenderGlyph, "e" variable resizing is not really needed.
	- Add tests for MeasureString and fix broken stuff there.
	- Test out the subsampling of the stb rasterizer.
	- Implement the custom renderer you've been thinking of, wink
Emotion.Test
	- Derivation checks shouldn't straight out check if the components are equal, but rather compare the difference to an epsilon as some drivers round colors differently
	- The current max derivation % is 400 instead of 100
	- Test functions which are run at the start and end of a class.
Documentation
	- Finish the documentation :D
Game Logic
	- UI with scaling and some kind of event capturing/focus system
	- Add RichText tests
Platform
	- Mac
	- Linux
	- Android
	- Web
Meta
	- Nuget Package
	- Autobuild nuget package, with version patching, and commit hash patching
Input
	- Controller Support (Wherever possible)
Emotion.Game
	- Bound box for the tile map - used to calculate only visible tiles and map only them.
Tools
	- FileExplorer extension matching per asset type (don't show those who don't match)
