## What is it?

A visual debugger for the Adfectus engine found [here](https://github.com/Cryru/Emotion).

The debugger uses Dear ImGui through the Adfectus.ImGuiNet plugin and the ImGuiNet binding to provide a debugging UI at runtime. 

## How to use it?

1. Download a built copy from the [releases section](https://github.com/Cryru/Rationale/releases) or build it yourself.
2. Extract and copy files in the same folder as an Adfectus executable.
3. Run the executable. If the Adfectus.dll was compiled in debug mode it will automatically load the debugger.

## Features

- Runtime statistics.
- Debug and step through scripts executed by your game.
- Debug loaded assets.
