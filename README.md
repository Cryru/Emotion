## What is it?

Emotion is a simplistic 2D game engine written in C#, based on the SDL2 framework.

Read more about this project's ancestry, and how it came to be [here](Documents/SoulEngine.md).

## Getting Started

You will need a C# IDE, and some programming ability, as this engine doesn't provide a drag-and-drop interface, or any interface at all for that matter.

For examples you can refer to the [EmotionSandbox](EmotionSandbox) project.

## Notes

- It is recommended when cloning Emotion to use ```git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Cryru/Emotion.git``` because of the huge repository size.
