## What is it?

Emotion is a cross-platform game engine written in C# with minimal dependencies, for me to make games in. The engine is more targeted towards programmers and is alternative to stuff like MonoGame, FNA, and Love rather than Unity.

## Games

### [Electric Sleep](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1011620/Electric_Sleep/)

A visual novel for Windows, Linux, and x64 Mac.

The version this game was built on is kept in the "adfectus-backup" branch. 

### [Escape the Arcana](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2953200/Escape_the_Arcana/)

A roguelike deckbuilder for Windows and Linux, with an Android version built but not published.

The version this game was built on is kept in the "EtA" branch.

## Target Hardware:

- OpenGL 3.0 or higher supported hardware
  - Or DirectX 11 if ANGLE is enabled
  - Or a multi-core CPU if the Mesa software renderer is enabled
  - WebGL 2.0 on Web
- Be able to run the Net 9 runtime.
	- If older than Windows 10 you'll need the [C++ Redistributable 2015 Update 3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52685)
	- For Windows 7 you'll also need a specific security update [KB3063858](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=net60#dependencies)
- A supported platform:
	- Windows 32 and 64 bit
 	- Linux 64 bit (Steam Deck works too)
	- Android API 23+
 	- Or implement your own via PlatformBase :)

That's it.

## Developing and Building

It is recommended you develop with a cloned version of the Emotion repo linking 'Emotion.csproj' and 'Emotion.SourceGeneration' in your solution. This way you have the most control over your code.

## Credits and Dependencies

By default Emotion has no external dependencies, any third party code is copy-pasted and statically compiled inside the project.
Note: All third-party code used is also modified in some way, so updating it to newer versions isnt very straight forward.

Include the "LICENSE THIRD-PARTY" file from the repository in your exe when distributing.
