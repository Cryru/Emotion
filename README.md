# What is this?

SoulEngine is a game engine coded in C#, based on the MonoGame framework, and the successor to the unreleased SoulMono engine.
The engine provides a basis for objects essential to any game, in addition to a library of useful functions. Simply said,
this exists to provide a base of things that any game would need, and hopefully is useful to you.

# External Libraries

This project uses the ["TiledSharp"](https://github.com/marshallward/TiledSharp) library and parts of the ["MonoGame.Extended"](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended) library. These are included with this project
as there is some modified and additional code.
