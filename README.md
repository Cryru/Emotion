## What is it?

SoulEngine is a 2D Monogame based game engine based on the idea of low level code writing, flexibiliy, and DIY, as opposed to the script based, high level tool approach big engines have. Despite this, the point is not to complicate development, but rather make it easier and simpler without losing control. The end goal is to shorten the time it takes between coming up with an idea, getting a prototype ready, and eventually releasing a product.

While I try to update the engine as often as possible, that is not always possible as life gets in the way, so most of the big changes and rewrites are left to big yearly (which sometimes span an entire year) updates. Currently version 2017 is in development, but older versions can be found here:

* [SoulEngine 2016](https://github.com/Cryru/SoulEngine-2016)
* [SoulEngine 2016 Android](https://github.com/Cryru/SoulEngine-2016-Android)

## New Version's Idea

SoulEngine 2016 wasn't based on any particular idea and was pretty much over all the place. The 2017 version's philosophy is based on an entity-component system similar to the one Unity3D has, as well as a single "Scene", as opposed to the old Photoshop-like layer model.
