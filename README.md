## What is it?

SoulEngine is a 2D XNA/Monogame based game engine created on the idea of hands-on code writing and in-depth control as opposed to the script based approach big engines have. In addition it aims to make the development process easier, and to shorten the time it takes between coming up with an idea, getting a prototype ready, and even releasing a product.

While the plan is to update the engine often, that is not always possible, so most of the big changes and rewrites are left to big yearly updates. Currently version 2017 is in development and not ready to be used but older versions can be found here:

* [SoulEngine 2016](https://github.com/Cryru/SoulEngine-2016)
* [SoulEngine 2016 Android](https://github.com/Cryru/SoulEngine-2016-Android)

In addition to these big updates the new versions are mostly backwards compatible.

## Idea

SoulEngine 2016 wasn't based on any particular idea and was pretty much over all the place. The 2017 version's philosophy is based on an entity-component system similar to the one Unity3D has, as well as a single "Scene", as opposed to the old Photoshop-like layer model.
