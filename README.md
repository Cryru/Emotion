## What is it?

SoulEngine is a 2D Monogame orientated game engine based on the idea of low-level code writing, flexibility, DIY, and control. The project's goal is to provide easy to use and understand APIs and concepts for programmers in order to shorten the amount of time it takes between coming up with an idea, getting a prototype ready, and eventually releasing a product.

## Updates

While I try to update the engine as often as possible, most of the big features, refactorings, and rewrites are done in the form of big yearly updates. The newest version is found on the [master branch](https://github.com/Cryru/SoulEngine), while older versions can be found on the other branches, or at these links:

* [SoulEngine 2017](https://github.com/Cryru/SoulEngine/tree/2017)
* [SoulEngine 2016](https://github.com/Cryru/SoulEngine/tree/2016)
* [SoulEngine 2016 Android](https://github.com/Cryru/SoulEngine/tree/2016Android)

## This Year's Idea

SoulEngine 2018 is on hold.
