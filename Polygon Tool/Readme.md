##What?

Polygon Tool is a javascript application for generating physics vertices for [SoulEngine](https://github.com/Cryru/SoulEngine).
A version of this tool is included with SoulEngine version 0.90 and onward.

##How?

To generate vertices first place your image in the same folder as the application and change its name to "image.png".
Then open PolygonApp.html, and you should see your image in the center of a gray rectangle (if you did everything right).
You can start clicking to place vertices, and once you are ready all you have to do is copy the generated code.
