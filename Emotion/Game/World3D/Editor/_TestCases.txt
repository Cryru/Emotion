Editor Main (World3DEditor) When the current scene has a map loaded.
1. Can start editor by pressing F3
1.1 The name of the current map is displayed on the right, with its file name
2. Can move camera WASD, Space and Shift to go up and down
3. Object editor can be toggled using Objects->Selection (this doesnt close the dropdown)

Editor UI (World3DEditor.Interface)
1. Top bar opens dropdowns
1.1 Clicking outside the dropdown closes it and consumes the click
1.2 When the dropdown is open rollover on another button will open its dropdown too
1.3 When the dropdown closes none of the buttons are selected

Object Editor (World3DEditor.Objects)
1. Editor selection is on by default
2. Can see objects their bounds and nameplates are displayed, and nameplates move in 3d space
2.1 Rollover works, on nameplates too
2.2 Object rollover shows up
3. Clicking on an object displays the translation gizmo
3.1. Clicking and dragging on a gizmo arrow allows the object to be moved.
3.2. The gizmo sticks to the object even if it is moved by other logic (Properties panel)

4. Clicking Objects->Add Object opens a panel listing all serializable classes that inherit GameObject3D.
4.1 Selecting a class will create a new object of that type, and automatically stick it to the mouse. (TODO)
4.2 Clicking somewhere will untether the object. (TODO)

5. Right clicking an object's nameplate opens a context menu.
5.1 Copy
5.2 Cut
5.3 Delete
5.4 Right clicking in an empty space opens a context menu with "Paste" (test with copy and cut)
5.4.1 Pasted objects are persistable
5.5 Properties

6. The properties panel lists all serializable object properties and is updated live. Properties can be changed.
6.1 Changing a property reinitializes the object. Objects dont need to handle changes mid lifecycle
6.2 The object is still persistable and has the same unique id after an edit.
