    <description>
      Emotion is a cross-platform game engine written in C# using .NetCore, with the intent of abstracting the lower levels of game programming, without taking away control from the developer. The core principle is that making games as a programmer should be about coding, and not about drag and drop interfaces, or wrestling with linking libraries and making the same interfaces over and over again. I made this to provide indie developers (and mostly myself) with a foundation which can be extended and adapted to a game's needs.

      This package is a debug build. For a release version clone and build yourself.
