The decoders (and encoders) are adapted (improved and simplified) versions of the ones found in https://github.com/yufeih/Nine.Imaging
Most of the comments in the code is taken from there, which is why it might reference things like "new versions".

Additionally some snippets are taken from https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp to improve supported formats.
