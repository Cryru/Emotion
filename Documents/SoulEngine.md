### What is SoulEngine?

This project's "ancestor".

### Where is it?

Buried within the stripped of binaries (hopefully) git history of this repo.

### What happened?

After developing SoulEngine for 3 years parallel to some game development I realized that I wasn't living the dream. I wasn't making games, I was overengineering engines. I like to think I've learned something over this period time and that it wasn't all for nothing, but I'm still not entirely sure. This year (2018) was kind of breaking in that I tried to embrace OpenGL and move away from already existing frameworks, but I ended up digging even deeper into things I only saw as obstacles to making it all come true.

### So?

I've restarted the project under the name "Emotion" and with different goals in mind. First of all I am going to develop the engine alongside my games rather than instead of. Secondly, I'm going to aim for reusing code as much as possible as opposed to deleting everything all the time, as this:

is absolute insane and unproductive.

Maybe I'll get it right this time? Probably not.
