Proposals for Emotion Engine Features

# Save File Controller

Inherit from a managed object.
System syncs changes to the object with a json file on the system.
IsSaving variable, with async IO.
Remove Soul.IO as a dependency.

# Soul

Move MathHelper to Emotion.Math

# Debugger

Move thread start to module start so Context running can be used. Also move Context IsRunning to before module setup.
